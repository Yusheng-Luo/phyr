# phyr

The goal of phyr is to collect and update functions that:

- calculate alpha phylogenetic diversity (`psv`, `psr`, `pse`, etc.) and beta phylogenetic diversity (`PCD`) from the picante package
- fitting phylogenetic logistic regressions (`binaryPGLMM`) from the ape package
- fitting phylogenetic generalized linear mixed models (`communityPGLMM`) from the pez package
