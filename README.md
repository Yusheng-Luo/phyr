phyr
====

The goal of phyr is to collect and update (with c++ for core parts) functions that:

-   calculate alpha phylogenetic diversity (`psv`, `psr`, `pse`, etc.) and beta phylogenetic diversity (`pcd`) from the picante package
-   fitting phylogenetic logistic regressions (`binaryPGLMM`) from the ape package
-   fitting phylogenetic generalized linear mixed models (`communityPGLMM`) from the pez package
-   and more.
